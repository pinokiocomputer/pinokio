This template I created will run an automatic install of Pinokio Browser on a virtual Linux GUI Desktop. Pinokio offers a big library of creative tools like Facefusion, you can view the current list here. It runs the exact same way as your local install would only it's super fast i.e. my benchmark screenshot for Facefusion below...

For image and video generation I've achieved great speeds with high memory CPUs (51-128GB) and Nvida RTX 4090 GPUs. I had a bunch of messages on Reddit related to Vast AI so I created this template to make onboarding to the App even easier. Will be creating a youtube tutorial as soon as I can to relate to this new template and how to truly achieve breakneck speeds for your swaps. My instance performs >400% faster than my M3 Pro Macbook Pro achieves in Facefusion Benchmarks!

Feel free to follow up with any questions you may have, I'm eager to make this template seamless and happy to try and guide you a bit even though I'm not a Linux or Cloud Computing genius...
